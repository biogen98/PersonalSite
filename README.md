### details:
- Build using the open-source static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/. Hugo provides a community made collection of themes. For this site I used a slightly modefied version of the [axiom](https://www.netlify.com/) theme. Axiom is designed to make the readers of your content and the search engines happy. A typical "Article" with Adsense ads, web fonts, syntax highlighting, and large Hero image has a Mobile PageSpeed of 95 running on the lowest tier cloud server plan
- Hosted on [Github](https://github.com/)
- Deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
