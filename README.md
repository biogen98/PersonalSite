### details:
- Build using the open-source static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo provides a robust theming system and a extensive catalogue of community made themes. For this site I used a slightly modefied version of the [axiom](https://www.netlify.com/) theme.
- The website is Deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), straight from this Github repository. This combination enables the site to reach a Mobile PageSpeed of 95.
